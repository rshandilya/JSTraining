<h1>Class and Module</h1>
<h2>The Secret Life of Objects</h2>
<h3>Prototypes</h3>
<pre>
let empty = {};
console.log(empty.toString);
//  function toString()…{}
console.log(empty.toString());
// [object Object]
</pre>

In addition to their set of properties, most objects
also have a <i>prototype</i>. A<b>prototype</b> is another object that is 
used as a fallback source of properties. When an object gets a request for a 
property that it does not have, its prototype will be searched for the property, then the prototype’s
prototype, and so on.

<p>
So who is the prototype of that empty object? It is the great ancestral
prototype, the entity behind almost all objects, <b>Object.prototype</b>.
The <b>Object.getPrototypeOf</b> returns the prototype of an object.
</p>

<pre>
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf({}) == Object.prototype);
// → true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype));
// → null
</pre>
<p>The prototype relations of JavaScript objects form a tree-shaped structure,
  and at the root of this structure sits Object.prototype. It provides a few
  methods that show up in all objects, such as toString, which converts an
  object to a string representation.</p>

<p>Many objects don’t directly have Object.prototype as their prototype but
  instead have another object that provides a different set of default 
  properties. Functions derive from <b>Function.prototype</b>, and arrays 
  derive from <b>Array.prototype</b>.</p>

<pre>
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Math.max) == Function.prototype);
// → true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf([]) == Array.prototype);
// → true
</pre>

<p>Such a prototype object will itself have a prototype, often 
  Object.prototype, so that it still indirectly provides methods like toString.
  You can use <b>Object.create</b> to create an object with a 
  specific prototype.</p>

<pre>
let protoRabbit = {
  speak(line) {
    console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says '${line}'`);
  }
};

let killerRabbit = Object.create(protoRabbit);
killerRabbit.type = "killer";
killerRabbit.speak("SKREEEE!");
//The killer rabbit says 'SKREEEE!'
</pre>
<h3>Classes</h3>
A class defines the shape of a type of object—what methods and properties 
it has. Such an object is called an <i>instance</i>  of the class.

<p>Prototypes are useful for defining properties for which all instances of a 
  class   share the same value, such as methods. Properties that differ per
   instance,   such as our rabbits’ type property, need to be stored directly in the objects
  themselves.</p>

<p>So to create an instance of a given class, you have to make an object that
    derives from the proper prototype, but you also have to make sure it, itself, has
    the properties that instances of this class are supposed to have. This is what a
    constructor function does.</p>
<pre>
function makeRabbit(type) {
  let rabbit = Object.create(protoRabbit);
  rabbit.type = type;
  return rabbit;
}
</pre>

<p>
  If you put the keyword new in front of a function call, the function is 
  treated as   a constructor. This means that an object with the right
   prototype is automatically created, bound to this in the function, and 
   returned at the end of the function.
</p>

<p>The prototype object used when constructing objects is found by taking 
  the  prototype property of the constructor function.</p>

<pre>
function Rabbit(type) {
  this.type = type;
}

Rabbit.prototype.speak = function(line) {
  console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says '${line}'`);
};

let weirdRabbit = new Rabbit("weird");
</pre>
<p>
  Constructors (all functions, in fact) automatically get a property named
<b>prototype</b>, which by default holds a plain, empty object that derives from
<b>Object.prototype</b>. 
By convention, the names of constructors are capitalized so that they can
easily be distinguished from other functions
</p>

<h3>Class Notation</h3>
So JavaScript classes are constructor functions with a prototype property. That
is how they work, and until 2015, that was how you had to write them. These
days, we have a less awkward notation.

<pre>
//syntax
class MyClass {
  // class methods
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  method3() { ... }
}
</pre>



Then new MyClass() creates a new object with all the listed methods.
The constructor() method is called automatically by new , so we can initialize the object
there



<pre>
class Rabbit {
  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type;
  }

  speak(line) {
    console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says '${line}'`);
  }
}
let killerRabbit = new Rabbit("killer");
let blackRabbit = new Rabbit("black");
</pre>

<p>
  The class keyword starts a class declaration, which allows us to define a
  constructor and a set of methods all in a single place. Any number of methods
  may be written inside the declaration’s braces. The one named <b>constructor</b> 
  is treated specially. It provides the actual constructor function, which will be
  bound to the name Rabbit. The others are packaged into that constructor’s prototype.
</p>


<pre>
class Person {
  constructor(firstname, lastname) {
    this.firstname = firstname;
    this.lastname = lastname;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log("Hi there! I'm", this.firstname);
  }
}

let p = new Person("Maaike", "van Putten");

p.greet();
</pre>

<h3>Class inheritance</h3>

<pre>
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.speed = 0;
    this.name = name;
  } 
  run(speed) {
    this.speed += speed;
    alert(`${this.name} runs with speed ${this.speed}.`);
  } 
  stop() {
    this.speed = 0;
    alert(`${this.name} stopped.`);
  }
}

let animal = new Animal("My animal");

// Inherit from Animal by specifying "extends Animal"

class Rabbit extends Animal {
  hide() {
    alert(`${this.name} hides!`);
  }
} 
let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit");

rabbit.run(5); // White Rabbit runs with speed 5.
rabbit.hide(); // White Rabbit hides!
</pre>

<h4>Overriding a method</h4>
Classes provide "<b>super</b>" keyword for that.
<ul>
<li><b>super.method(...)</b> to call a parent method.</li>
<li><b>super(...)</b> to call a parent constructor (inside our constructor only).</li>
</ul>
<pre>
class Rabbit extends Animal {
    hide() {
    alert(`${this.name} hides!`);
  } 

  stop() {
    super.stop(); // call parent stop
    this.hide(); // and then hide
  }
}

let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit");

rabbit.run(5); // White Rabbit runs with speed 5.
rabbit.stop(); // White Rabbit stopped. White rabbit hides!
</pre>

<h4>Overriding constructor</h4>
<pre>
class Rabbit extends Animal {
  // generated for extending classes without own constructors
  constructor(...args) {
    super(...args);
  }
}
</pre>

<h4>Getters and setters</h4>
Getters and setters are special properties that we can use to get data from a class and
to set data fields on the class. Getters and setters are computed properties.
<pre>
class CoffeeMachine {
    _waterAmount = 0;

  set waterAmount(value) {
    if (value &lt 0) throw new Error("Negative water");
    this._waterAmount = value;
  } 
  
  get waterAmount() {
    return this._waterAmount;
  }

  constructor(power) {
    this._power = power;
  }

  get power() {
    return this._power;
  }
}

let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);
// add water
coffeeMachine.waterAmount = -10; // Error: Negative water

alert(`Power is: ${coffeeMachine.power}W`); // Power is: 100W
coffeeMachine.power = 25; // Error (no setter)
