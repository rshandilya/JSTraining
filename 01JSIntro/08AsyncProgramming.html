<h1>Asynchronous Programming</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Since JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language with a synchronous
  execution model that processes one operation after another, it can only process one
  statement at a time. </p>

<p>If API calls were performed in a
  synchronous manner, the browser would not be able to handle any user input, 
  like   scrolling or clicking a button, until that operation completes. 
  This is known as <i>blocking</i> .</p>

<p>In order to prevent blocking behavior, the browser environment has many Web APIs that
  JavaScript can access that are <i>asynchronous</i>, meaning they can run in parallel with other
  operations instead of sequentially.</p>

<h3>The Event Loop</h3>
<p>JavaScript code that does not use any asynchronous Web APIs will execute in a
  synchronous manner—one at a time, sequentially.</p>


<pre>
// Define three example functions
function first() {
  console.log(1)
}

function second() {
  console.log(2)
}

function third() {
  console.log(3)
}

// Execute the functions
first()
second()
third()
</pre>

<p><b>setTimeout</b> takes two arguments: the function it will run asynchronously, and the
  amount of time it will wait before calling that function. 
  setTimeout needs to be asynchronous, otherwise the
  entire browser would remain frozen during the waiting, which would result in a poor 
  user experience.
</p>

<pre>
// Define three example functions, but one of them contains asynchronous code
function first() {
  console.log(1)
}

function second() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(2)
  }, 0)
}

function third() {
  console.log(3)
}

// Execute the functions
first()
second()
third()
</pre>
<p>Whether you set the timeout to zero seconds or five minutes will make no difference—the
  console.log called by asynchronous code will execute after the synchronous top-level
  functions. This happens because the JavaScript host environment, in this case the
  browser, uses a concept called the <b>event loop</b> to handle concurrency, or parallel events.
</p><p>
  Since JavaScript can only execute one statement at a time, it needs the event loop to be
  informed of when to execute which specific statement. The event loop handles this with
  the concepts of a <i>stack</i> and a <i>queue</i>.</p>

<h5>Stack</h5>
For the example only containing synchronous code, the browser handles the execution in
the following order:
<ul>
<li>Add first() to the stack, run first() which logs 1 to the console, remove
  first() from the stack.</li>

<li>Add second() to the stack, run second() which logs 2 to the console, remove
  second() from the stack.</li>

<li>Add third() to the stack, run third() which logs 3 to the console, remove
  third() from the stack.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second example with setTimout looks like this:

<ul>
  <li>Add first() to the stack, run first() which logs 1 to the console, remove
    first() from the stack.</li>
  
  <li>Add second() to the stack, run second() .
    Add setTimeout() to the stack, run the setTimeout() Web API which
    starts a timer and adds the anonymous function to the queue, remove
    setTimeout() from the stack.</li>
  
  <li>Remove second() from the stack.</li>
  <li>Add third() to the stack, run third() which logs 3 to the console, remove
    third() from the stack.</li>
  <li>The event loop checks the queue for any pending messages and finds the
    anonymous function from setTimeout() , adds the function to the stack which
    logs 2 to the console, then removes it from the stack.</li>
  
  </ul>

</p>
<h5>Queue</h5>
<p>The queue, also referred to as <i>message queue</i> or <i>task queue</i>, is a waiting area for
  functions. Whenever the call stack is empty, the event loop will check the queue for any
  waiting messages, starting from the oldest message. Once it finds one, it will add it to the
  stack, which will execute the function in the message.</p>

<p>This queue system exists because if the timer were to add the anonymous
  function directly to the stack when the timer finishes, it would interrupt whatever
  function is currently running, which could have unintended and unpredictable effects.</p>

<h3>Callback Functions</h3>
If you wanted to ensure one of the functions, like
the third function, ran after the timeout, then you would have to use asynchronous
coding methods.

<p>The original solution to dealing with this problem is using callback functions. 
  they are just a function that has been passed as an
argument to another function. The function that takes another function as an argument is
called a higher-order function.
</p>

<pre>
// A function
function fn() {
  console.log('Just a function')
}

// A function that takes another function as an argument
function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
  // When you call a function that is passed as an argument, it is referred to as a callback
  callback()
}

// Passing a function
higherOrderFunction(fn)
</pre>

<p>Let’s go back to the first , second , and third functions with setTimeout . 
  The task is to get the third function to always delay execution until after the
  asynchronous action in the second function has completed.
</p>

<pre>
// Define three functions
function first() {
  console.log(1)
}

function second(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(2)

    // Execute the callback function
    callback()
  }, 0)
}

function third() {
  console.log(3)
}

first()
second(third)

</pre>

<h4>Nested Callbacks and the Pyramid of Doom</h4>
However, due to the nested nature of callbacks, code can end up getting messy if 
you have a lot of consecutive asynchronous requests that rely on each other. This was a big frustration for JavaScript developers early
on, and as a result code containing nested callbacks is often called the “pyramid of doom”
or “callback hell.”

<pre>
  function pyramidOfDoom() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(1)
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(2)
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log(3)
        }, 500)
      }, 2000)
    }, 1000)
  }
</pre>

<h3>Promises</h3>
A promise represents the completion of an asynchronous function. It is an object that
might return a value in the future. It accomplishes the same basic goal as a callback
function, but with many additional features and a more readable syntax.

<h4>Creating a Promise</h4>
You can initialize a promise with the <b>new Promise</b> syntax, and you must initialize it
with a function. The function that gets passed to a promise has <b>resolve</b> and 
<b>reject</b> parameters. The resolve and reject functions handle the success and failure of an
operation, respectively.
<pre>
// Initialize a promise
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})
</pre>
So far, nothing has been set up for the promise, so it’s going to sit there in a pending
state forever. The first thing you can do to test out a promise is fulfill the promise by
resolving it with a value:

<pre>
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('We did it!')
})
</pre>
As stated in the beginning of this section, a promise is an object that may return a value.
After being successfully fulfilled, the value goes from undefined to being populated
with data.

<p>
  A promise can have three possible states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
<ul>
<li><b></b> Pending - Initial state before being resolved or rejected </li>
<li><b></b> Fulfilled - Successful operation, promise has resolved </li>
<li><b></b> Rejected - Failed operation, promise has rejected </li>
</ul>

<h4>Consuming a Promise</h4>
The promise in the last section has fulfilled with a value, but you also want to be able to
access the value. Promises have a method called <b>then</b> that will run after a promise
reaches resolve in the code. <i>then</i> will return the promise’s value as a parameter.

<pre>
promise.then((response) => {
  console.log(response)
})
</pre>
</p>


<pre>
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve(
    'Resolving an asynchronous request!'
    ), 2000)
})

// Log the result
promise.then((response) => {
  console.log(response)
})
</pre>

<pre>
// Chain a promise
promise
  .then((firstResponse) => {
    // Return a new value for the next then
    return firstResponse + ' And chaining!'
  })
  .then((secondResponse) => {
    console.log(secondResponse)
  })
</pre>

<h4>Error Handling</h4>
<pre>
function getUsers(onSuccess) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Handle resolve and reject in the asynchronous API
    }, 1000)
  })
}
</pre>

<pre>
function getUsers(onSuccess) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Handle resolve and reject in the asynchronous API
      if (onSuccess) {
        resolve([
          {id: 1, name: 'Jerry'},
          {id: 2, name: 'Elaine'},
          {id: 3, name: 'George'},
        ])
      } else {
        reject('Failed to fetch data!')
      }
    }, 1000)
  })
}
</pre>


If you switch the flag and resolve instead, the catch will be ignored, 
and the data will return instead:
<pre>
// Run the getUsers function with the false flag to trigger an error
getUsers(false)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
  })
</pre>



<h4>Async Functions with async/await</h4>

An async function allows you to handle asynchronous code in a manner that appears
synchronous. async functions still use promises under the hood, but have a more
traditional JavaScript syntax. 
<pre>
// Create an async function
async function getUser() {
  return {}
}

console.log(getUser())
</pre>
<pre>
getUser().then((response) => console.log(response))
</pre>
An <code>async</code> function can handle a promise called within it using the <b>await</b> operator.
<code>await</code> can be used within an <code>async</code> function and will wait until a promise settles
before executing the designated code.
<pre>
// Handle fetch with async/await
async function getUser() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/octocat')
  const data = await response.json()

  console.log(data)
}

// Execute async function
getUser()
</pre>
The <code>await</code> operators here ensure that the data is not logged before the request has
populated it with data.
